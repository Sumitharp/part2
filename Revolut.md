# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Revolut Ltd 

* Revolut was founded on 1 July 2015 by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. The company was originally based in Level39, a financial technology incubator in Canary Wharf, London. Revolut was initially launched in the UK and offered prepaid cards, multi currency exchange, international transfer to freelancers and Small and Medium Enterprises. 
 
* Nilkolay Storonsky, who had master's in physics and economics, was a trader at Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers prior to starting Revolut with Vlad Yatsenko, former Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank developer. Storonsky realised that he was waisting hundreds of pounds on forex fees and commissions when he was travelling. When he found out that multi-currency card were not possible at that time, he decided to come up with a  solution.    

* In 2016, the Revolut app registered 100,000 users and secured its first Series A funding of $8.4 million. They also raised Series B, C and D funding of c. $906 million. Totally the company has raised $916.5 million as of Feb 16 2021 by way of private equity.  The largest funding was in Feb 2020 of $580 million in Series D led by investment firm TCV , an early investor in Facebook and Netflix, which valued Revolut at $5.5 billion (increased 3x from $1.7 billion in April 2018).

## Business Activities:

Revolut initially gained popularity by issuing **prepaid cards** and allowing users to spend money in different currencies at inter bank exchange rates without paying high forex fees. It obtained European Bank license in 2018.In addition, Revolut is authorized in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011.

It has now evolved into new mobile app-based challenger bank which offers traditional banking services without costly overheads of physical branches. It currently provides personal banking services like early salary, pay and get paid, international transfers, Group bills, Budget and Analytics, Cards and Junior Acoounts, Crypto, Vaults, Saving Vaults. It provides individuals as well as business customers international bank transfers at the real exchange rates in major currencies and savings on hidden fees. These transfers are almost free and executed instantly between Europe, the US, Singapore, Japan, Australia amongst the 30+ countries.

Business customers can hold money in 28 different currencies and convert them easily. Revolut also provides features like spending control with cards, automating expense bookkeeping by using business APIs and Partner apps.

Revolut also launched a commission-free stocking trading app like Robinhood last year. 


* Revolut can only be used through mobile app and is not available on computers as a website for individuals. So its market is anyone who uses mobile phone which in the EU is 469 million and in the US is 275.6 million at the end of 2020. Revolut presently has 500,000 business customers and **12+ million personal customers.** It predominanty service  Euraopean Ecomonic Area countries, Switzerland, Australia and recently launched services in USA.There is significant growth potential evenif 10% or 75 million users adopt Revolut.

Although Revolut is a mobile only app, it still provides services like personal loans, phone and travel insurance, cryptocurrency purchase and virtual cards. A customer can open an account within couple of minutes by downloading the app and providing personal information and confirming identity. They are issued a physical card as well as a mobile app generated card for immediate use. This is unlike most traditional banks where customer has to personally visit a bank branch to open an account and wait for days to operate it. Traditional banks suffer as their legacy systems take a long time to upgrade and are impacted by digital frauds. It is also possible to create a disposable virtual card. They’re suitable for one-time, online transactions which automatically regenerate after each transaction made using a disposable virtual card. Revolut provides this extra layer of security for online transactions and protect against online card fraud.

##Technology
Revolut built its core infrastructure with Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Compute Engine virtual machines. With Cloud Identity and Access Management, Revolut could easily set up highly secure, separate instances for its main infrastructure and its application. The company also made extensive use of Cloud APIs in conjunction with a third-party automation tool to achieve fully automated infrastructure-as-code provisioning and management of the platform. (Google Case Study)

Revolut's technology is based predominantly on Java 8 on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend. They are also planning to introduce Scala for new components.They offer a minimalist approach in order to use external frameworks, with emphasis on maintainability and fast turnaround with TDD, DDD, and Continuous Integration & Delivery. Their projects include building the mobile APIs, developing microservices to evolve the architecture, and perfecting a number of systems that the business depends on – risk management, fraud detection, or payment processing, to name a few.Revolut takes advantage of Kotlin as well. Its developers recently shared an exciting presentation on how they use Kotlin to build a multiplatform architecture for iOS and Android. In addition to writing in Kotlin, they also include Android SDK and RxJava serve as internal libraries and frameworks. As for data storage they use SQLite with Room OM. However, the company continues to use JavaScript, HTML, Python, TypeScript, Groovy, C++ and Clojure within their different areas of work. By using the RecyclerView-based screen layout they establish and maintain UI elements. In this way when developers need to adjust to a different style, they take an already completed element and attach it to the RecyclerView. This approach is proven to be quite beneficial during bigger redesigns. The only changes were made with the UI elements and mappers while the UX logic was left untouched.(Stackshare, jobs.lever)



## Landscape:

* According to Research and Markets report on Neo and Challenger Banks 2020-27, the global Neo and challenger bank industry was valued at $20.4 billion in 2019, and the market size is projected to reach $471 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 48.1% from 2020 to 2027. These bank are digital-only banks without any physical branches and operate on a partnered bank license in the market. These banks are continuously challenging existing traditional banks, by innovating & integrating several technologies in their product offerings and providing real-time services and client-centric products & services. Additionally, higher interest rates on deposits/savings compared to traditional banks, regulatory support, mobile based applications and expansion in emerging/unbanked economies are main drivers of this market.

Some of competitors in this Fintech space are NuBank (Brazil), Atom Bank Plc (UK), Fidor Solutions AG (EU), Monzo Bank Limited (UK), Movencorp, Inc. (USA), MYbank (EU), Number26 GmbH(Germany), Simple Finance Technology Corporation (taken over by BBVA), Tandem Bank (UK),UBank limited (Australia), WeBank (China). There are also single product or service companies which provide online disagreggrated services like Venmo/Paypal for payments, Mission Lane/Ollo for credit cards, Avant/Rocket loans for consumer loans, Affirm/Klarna for point-of-sale financing, Marcus by Goldman Sachs/Chime for deposits and debit cards. In the future, we will likely see that these single product companies start providing more services to their customers on the lines of traditional banks. There could also be mergers of the challenger banks with traditional banks which want to provide services to their modern consumers.   




## Results

Revolut’s losses trebled in 2019 to £104.7 million, following a year of rapid growth mainly due to increase in staff by 1,628 , as well as launch in the US and Singapore. In 2019, revenue increased 3x to £162.7 million from £58.2 million. Gross margin improved to 39% in final quarter of 2019 up from 17% at the beginning of the year. Most of its revenue is generated from cut in the interchange fee paid to Mastercard, membership fees of its cards, and business accounts.

Key performance indicators:
* Revenue growth: Increase of 180% on 2018
* Total retail investors: 10 million (3.5 million in 2018) increased to 12 million at the end of 2020.
* Daily active people: 231% increase yoy
* Total paid users:260% increase since last reporting date
* Weekly active business: 321% increase since last reporting





* Compared to Competition
Revolut has performed better as compared to its EEA rivals. Revolut's revenue is 2019 was ~£160 million compared to Monzo's £67 million and Starling £30 million. At the end of  2019, Revolut had 10 million customers far greater than 2.5 million of Monzo and 1 million of Starling. Further, Revolut's average contribution per customer was £24 compared to £21 (Monzo) and £20 (Starling). Revolut's total transaction volume was £65 billion in 2019 is 5x more than Monzo. However, Revolut's customer base is half that of NuBank (Brazil) which is seen as a revolutionary bank in Latin America, especially in countries like Brazil where the interest rate is very high and traditional banks charge high fees on every transaction. Additionally, Revolut's competitor Chime (North America) has large customer base in US (8 million in 2020) with decent revenues and deposit base which the neo banks from EEA donot enjoy as they are still not primary accounts for most customers. There is also Sofi bank (USA) (2x Revolut's revenue) which generates most of its revenue from student loans and repayments.


## Recommendations

* Revolut can expand it horizons by servicing new geographies like Asia which are underbanked and have high mobile penetration.  

Center for Resposible Lending in its Overdarft Fees 2020 report states that traditional banks charged $11 billion in overdraft fees in 2019. Revolut can provide free overdraft facilites on debit card purchases like Chime currently does (upto $100) which will make it more appealing to many customers.  Further, Revolut can also enter the student loan market like Sofi. These students would later continue banking with Revolut and use more services as they join the workforce.
